## About This Project

This repository is more than just a collection of files. It's a reflection of:
- **My Growth**: How I am developing myself this year, day by day.
- **My Emotions**: A space to share how I feel, including the moments I feel lonely or forgetful.
- **My Journey**: A journal to see how far I‚Äôve come and where life can take me by the end of this year.

## Why I Started This Project

Life can feel tough sometimes. I often feel lonely, forgetful, or unsure of where I'm heading. But this repository is my reminder to keep going, to trust Allah, and to believe that every step is part of a greater plan.

This is a space for me to:
- Share my struggles and small victories.
- Reflect on how I‚Äôm growing over time.
- Inspire myself and, maybe, someone else who might feel low.

If you ever feel sad or lost, come back to this repository. Maybe something I‚Äôve shared here will make you feel a little better. We‚Äôre all on a journey, and this is mine.

## My Daily Journey Logs

I document my daily experiences in the [**logs folder**](https://github.com/Silicon-Sorceress-Tawfia/Fail_Better_Tomorrow/tree/main/logs).  
Each day is captured in a separate markdown file, covering:
- What I did
- How I felt
- What I learned
- A motivational quote for the day

Feel free to browse through the logs to see my progress or gain inspiration for your own journey!
