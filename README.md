# Fail_Better_Tomorrow

Welcome to my personal repository, **Fail_Better_Tomorrow**, where I document my daily coding journey, emotions, struggles, and the lessons I learn along the way. 🚀

## About This Project

This repository is more than just a collection of files. It's a reflection of:
- **My Growth**: How I am developing myself this year, day by day.
- **My Emotions**: A space to share how I feel, including the moments I feel lonely or forgetful.
- **My Journey**: A journal to see how far I’ve come and where life can take me by the end of this year.

## Why I Started This Project

Life can feel tough sometimes. I often feel lonely, forgetful, or unsure of where I'm heading. But this repository is my reminder to keep going, to trust Allah, and to believe that every step is part of a greater plan.

This is a space for me to:
- Share my struggles and small victories.
- Reflect on how I’m growing over time.
- Inspire myself and, maybe, someone else who might feel low.

If you ever feel sad or lost, come back to this repository. Maybe something I’ve shared here will make you feel a little better. We’re all on a journey, and this is mine.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository will have:
- **Daily logs**: Markdown files like `day1.md`, `day2.md`, etc.
- **Motivational Quotes**: A collection of sayings or words that inspire me.
- **Life Reflections**: Notes on what I learn about life as I go through this year.

## Final Thoughts

This journey isn’t to show off or prove anything to anyone. It’s just for me. To see how life unfolds and how Allah guides me through this year. Let’s see where this path takes me. 💫
