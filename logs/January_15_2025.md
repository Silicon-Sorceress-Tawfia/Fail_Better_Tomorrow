## How I Feel Today
Today, I feel a bit sad about my studies. My brain feels fogged, and I realize that I’ve been procrastinating a lot. I don’t feel like studying or doing much of anything.

At the same time, I can’t help but think about others who study, code, and achieve so much. It’s overwhelming, but I know I can do better if I try. InshAllah, I’ll make today productive.

## My Plan for Today
- **Study for more than 4 hours.**
- **Focus on:** Compiler Design – I’ll complete 2 chapters today.

## My Commitment
Even though it’s hard, I know I have to push myself. This is a small step forward, but I’ll give it my best effort. Let’s see how the day unfolds.
